# Shape Spec

Gather context and structure planning for significant work. **Run this command while in plan mode.**

## Important Guidelines

- **Always use AskUserQuestion tool** when asking the user anything
- **Offer suggestions** — Present options the user can confirm, adjust, or correct
- **Keep it lightweight** — This is shaping, not exhaustive documentation

## Prerequisites

This command **must be run in plan mode**.

**Before proceeding, check if you are currently in plan mode.**

If NOT in plan mode, **stop immediately** and tell the user:

```
Shape-spec must be run in plan mode. Please enter plan mode first, then run /shape-spec again.
```

Do not proceed with any steps below until confirmed to be in plan mode.

## Process

### Step 1: Clarify What We're Building

Use AskUserQuestion to understand the scope:

```
What are we building? Please describe the feature or change.

(Be as specific as you like — I'll ask follow-up questions if needed)
```

Based on their response, ask 1-2 clarifying questions if the scope is unclear. Examples:
- "Is this a new feature or a change to existing functionality?"
- "What's the expected outcome when this is done?"
- "Are there any constraints or requirements I should know about?"

### Step 2: Gather Visuals

Use AskUserQuestion:

```
Do you have any visuals to reference?

- Mockups or wireframes
- Screenshots of similar features
- Examples from other apps

(Paste images, share file paths, or say "none")
```

If visuals are provided, note them for inclusion in the spec folder.

### Step 3: Identify Reference Implementations

Use AskUserQuestion:

```
Is there similar code in this codebase I should reference?

Examples:
- "The comments feature is similar to what we're building"
- "Look at how src/features/notifications/ handles real-time updates"
- "No existing references"

(Point me to files, folders, or features to study)
```

If references are provided, read and analyze them to inform the plan.

### Step 4: Check Product Context

Check if `agent-os/product/` exists and contains files.

If it exists, read key files (like `mission.md`, `roadmap.md`, `tech-stack.md`) and use AskUserQuestion:

```
I found product context in agent-os/product/. Should this feature align with any specific product goals or constraints?

Key points from your product docs:
- [summarize relevant points]

(Confirm alignment or note any adjustments)
```

If no product folder exists, skip this step.

### Step 5: Surface Relevant Standards

Read `agent-os/standards/index.yml` to identify relevant standards based on the feature being built.

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm:

```
Based on what we're building, these standards may apply:

1. **api/response-format** — API response envelope structure
2. **api/error-handling** — Error codes and exception handling
3. **database/migrations** — Migration patterns

Should I include these in the spec? (yes / adjust: remove 3, add frontend/forms)
```

Read the confirmed standards files to include their content in the plan context.

### Step 6: Classify Domain & Generate Spec Path

Use AskUserQuestion to classify the domain:

```
What domain does this feature belong to?

Examples: auth, billing, notifications, inventory, users, reports

(This determines where the spec is saved under agent-os/specs/)
```

Then derive the feature slug from the feature description (lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars).

The spec path will be:
```
agent-os/specs/{domain}/{feature-slug}/
```

Example: `agent-os/specs/auth/password-reset/`

**Notes:**
- If `agent-os/specs/` or the domain folder doesn't exist, create them when saving the spec.
- If `agent-os/specs/{domain}/_index.md` doesn't exist, create it with the initial template.

### Step 7: Structure the Plan

Now build the plan with **Task 1 always being "Save spec documentation"**.

Present this structure to the user:

```
Here's the plan structure. Task 1 saves all our shaping work before implementation begins.

---

## Task 1: Save Spec Documentation

Create or update `agent-os/specs/{domain}/_index.md` — append a row for this feature:
`| {feature-slug} | draft | [spec]({feature-slug}/spec.md) | [tasks]({feature-slug}/tasks.md) |`

Create `agent-os/specs/{domain}/{feature-slug}/` with:

- **spec.md** — The full plan (what & why)
- **tasks.md** — Implementation checklist
- **shape.md** — Shaping notes (scope, decisions, context from our conversation)
- **standards.md** — Relevant standards that apply to this work
- **references.md** — Pointers to reference implementations studied
- **sub-specs/** — Empty folder, ready for technical breakdowns

## Task 2: [First implementation task]

[Description based on the feature]

## Task 3: [Next task]

...

---

Does this plan structure look right? I'll fill in the implementation tasks next.
```

### Step 8: Complete the Plan

After Task 1 is confirmed, continue building out the remaining implementation tasks based on:
- The feature scope from Step 1
- Patterns from reference implementations (Step 3)
- Constraints from standards (Step 5)

Each task should be specific and actionable.

### Step 9: Ready for Execution

When the full plan is ready:

```
Plan complete. When you approve and execute:

1. Task 1 will save all spec documentation first
2. Then implementation tasks will proceed

Ready to start? (approve / adjust)
```

## Output Structure

```
agent-os/specs/{domain}/
├── _index.md                        # Domain manifest — one row per feature
└── {feature-slug}/
    ├── spec.md                      # The full plan (what & why)
    ├── tasks.md                     # Implementation checklist
    ├── shape.md                     # Shaping decisions and context
    ├── standards.md                 # Which standards apply and key points
    ├── references.md                # Pointers to similar code
    └── sub-specs/                   # Technical breakdowns (added later)
```

`_index.md` initial template:
```markdown
# {Domain} — Specs Index

| Feature | Status | Spec | Tasks |
|---|---|---|---|
```

## shape.md Content

The shape.md file should capture:

```markdown
# {Feature Name} — Shaping Notes

## Scope

[What we're building, from Step 1]

## Decisions

- [Key decisions made during shaping]
- [Constraints or requirements noted]

## Context

- **Visuals:** [List of visuals provided, or "None"]
- **References:** [Code references studied]
- **Product alignment:** [Notes from product context, or "N/A"]

## Standards Applied

- api/response-format — [why it applies]
- api/error-handling — [why it applies]
```

## standards.md Content

Include the full content of each relevant standard:

```markdown
# Standards for {Feature Name}

The following standards apply to this work.

---

## api/response-format

[Full content of the standard file]

---

## api/error-handling

[Full content of the standard file]
```

## references.md Content

```markdown
# References for {Feature Name}

## Similar Implementations

### {Reference 1 name}

- **Location:** `src/features/comments/`
- **Relevance:** [Why this is relevant]
- **Key patterns:** [What to borrow from this]

### {Reference 2 name}

...
```

## Tips

- **Keep shaping fast** — Don't over-document. Capture enough to start, refine as you build.
- **Visuals are optional** — Not every feature needs mockups.
- **Standards guide, not dictate** — They inform the plan but aren't always mandatory.
- **Specs are discoverable** — Months later, someone can find this spec and understand what was built and why.

## Batch Mode

This command can be driven programmatically by the `specs-from-plan-product` skill with all
interactive questions pre-answered from an existing `plan-product/specs/` spec file.

When an agent prompt begins with `BATCH MODE`:

- Skip all `AskUserQuestion` calls — all inputs are already provided in the prompt
- Write all 6 output files without waiting for approval
- Still create or update `agent-os/specs/{domain}/_index.md` with the feature row
- The `spec-integrity.sh` PostToolUse hook fires automatically per file written and validates
  `_index.md` registration and sub-spec link integrity

A valid batch-mode prompt must supply:
- `Domain` and `Feature slug` (determines output path)
- Full source spec content (from `plan-product/specs/`)
- Full verbatim content of each standard to apply (not just names)
- Codebase reference paths with relevance notes
- Cross-cutting constraints that apply to all specs in this batch
